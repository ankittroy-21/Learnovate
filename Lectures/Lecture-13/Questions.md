# Queue - Questions

## Question 1: Basic Queue Implementation
Implement a queue using arrays with basic operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and isFull. Handle queue full and empty conditions properly.

## Question 2: Queue Using Stacks
Implement a queue using two stacks. Make enqueue operation O(1) and dequeue operation O(n) amortized.

## Question 3: Reverse First K Elements
Given a queue and an integer k, reverse the first k elements of the queue while maintaining the relative order of remaining elements.

## Question 4: Generate Binary Numbers
Generate first n binary numbers using a queue. Example: For n=5, output should be "1", "10", "11", "100", "101".

## Question 5: Sliding Window Maximum
Given an array of integers and a window size k, find the maximum element in each sliding window as it moves from left to right.

## Question 6: Circular Queue Implementation
Design and implement a circular queue with fixed size. The circular queue should support enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, isEmpty, and isFull operations.

## Question 7: Task Scheduler
Given a list of tasks represented by characters and a cooling period n, find the minimum time required to complete all tasks. You cannot execute the same task within n intervals.

## Question 8: Rotten Oranges
Given a grid where each cell can have: 0 (empty), 1 (fresh orange), 2 (rotten orange). Every minute, rotten oranges make adjacent fresh oranges rotten. Return the minimum time until no fresh oranges remain, or -1 if impossible.

## Question 9: Maximum of All Subarrays of Size K (Optimized)
Solve the sliding window maximum problem in O(n) time complexity using a deque instead of O(n log k).

## Question 10: First Negative in Every Window of Size K
Given an array and a positive integer k, find the first negative integer in every window of size k. If no negative number exists in window, return 0.
