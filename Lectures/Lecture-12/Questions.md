# Question No. 1
> Implement a stack using arrays with proper exception handling for stack overflow and underflow. Include push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and isFull operations.

# Question No. 2
> Write a program to check balanced parentheses for multiple bracket types ([], {}, ()). Handle edge cases like empty string and strings without brackets.

# Question No. 3
> Create a browser history system using two stacks that supports visit(url), back(), and forward() operations with proper boundary checks.

# Question No. 4
> Implement a special stack that supports getMinimum() operation in O(1) time complexity using an auxiliary stack.

# Question No. 5
> Write a program to evaluate postfix expressions handling multi-digit numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

# Question No. 6
> Convert an infix expression to postfix notation using stack, handling operator precedence and parentheses.

# Question No. 7
> Solve the next greater element problem for an array using stack with O(n) time complexity.

# Question No. 8
> Implement two stacks in a single array efficiently, ensuring both stacks can grow without fixed partitioning.

# Question No. 9
> Design a stack that supports push, pop, and getMax() operations, all in O(1) time complexity.

# Question No. 10
> Write a program to reverse a stack using recursion without using any additional data structures.
