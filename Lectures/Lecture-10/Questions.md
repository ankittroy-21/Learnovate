# Question No. 1
> Write a Java program to create a string "Hello World" and demonstrate the following operations:
> - Print the length of the string
> - Convert it to uppercase
> - Extract substring "World" from it
> - Check if it contains the word "Java"

# Question No. 2
> Create a Java program that takes two strings "Java" and "Programming" and performs:
> - Concatenate them using both `+` operator and `concat()` method
> - Compare them using `equals()` and `equalsIgnoreCase()`
> - Replace all 'a' characters with 'o' in the first string

# Question No. 3
> Write a program that demonstrates string immutability:
> - Create a string "Hello" and try to concatenate " World" without reassigning
> - Show that the original string remains unchanged
> - Then reassign the result and show the updated string

# Question No. 4
> Create a Java program using StringBuilder to:
> - Initialize with "Java"
> - Append " is fun" to it
> - Insert "Programming " at the beginning
> - Reverse the entire string
> - Print the result at each step

# Question No. 5
> Write a program that takes a string with extra spaces: "   Learn Java Programming   " and:
> - Remove leading and trailing spaces using `trim()`
> - Convert to lowercase
> - Extract the word "Java" using substring
> - Check if it starts with "Learn" after trimming

# Question No. 6
> Create a program that demonstrates character extraction and comparison:
> - Take a string "Programming"
> - Extract character at index 4
> - Find the index of first 'g' in the string
> - Compare "Java" and "JAVA" using both case-sensitive and case-insensitive methods

# Question No. 7
> Write a Java program that shows the difference between String and StringBuilder:
> - Use String concatenation in a loop (inefficient way)
> - Use StringBuilder append in a loop (efficient way)
> - Compare the performance approach for both methods

# Question No. 8
> Create a program that performs multiple string operations on "Java Programming Language":
> - Find its length
> - Replace "Java" with "Python"
> - Extract "Programming" using substring
> - Convert the entire string to uppercase
> - Check if it ends with "Language"

# Question No. 9
> Write a program that demonstrates string pool concept:
> - Create two strings using literals with same value
> - Create one string using new keyword with same value
> - Compare them using == operator and equals() method
> - Explain the results

# Question No. 10
> Create a comprehensive program that uses all these string methods together:
> - length(), charAt(), substring(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase()
> - trim(), replace(), equals(), equalsIgnoreCase()
> - contains(), startsWith(), endsWith()
